    <h1>Why don't I like javascript?</h1>
<p>01 Nov 2018 - Rick</p>

<p>Any client<->server service not located on the web will have the client connect to the server and request resources and information from that server. It is then the server's job to do whatever processing is necessary in order to deliver that information, hence the name: server. It serves you information. </p>
<p>The implementation of javascript into a user's browser allows websites to remotely execute code of their choosing on that user's machine, offloading the job of the server onto the user. This also allows for arbitrary data collection from the user, which is definitely the opposite of the client's job in this relationship. Once a company running a website, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. gets access to your data, they tend to sell it to data brokers who sell it to places like advertising companies and government agencies. Hurray for javascript. </p>
<p>Javascript has the added bonus of causing the user to experience performance issues doing something as simple as interacting with or visiting a webpage. Something most computers have been able to do for almost 2 decades now.  
<p>This website is served as a series of completely static pages generated from some simple templates using a ruby gem called Jekyll. It simply outputs plain html and css files and I host them. It's that easy.
