  <h1>Why don't I like Windows? (and Microsoft in general)</h1>

  <ul>
  <li>If you buy a piece of hardware, it should be your property. </li>
  <p>When you buy a computer from a computer retailer, what you are paying for
    is the hardware that makes up a computer system. It should be reasonable
    to say that you are allowed to run whatever software you desire on this
    hardware you purchased, and for most computers for most of the time that
    computers have been around, this was true.</p>
  <li>Microsoft denies users partially or fully of this control</li>
  <p>Around the time that Windows 8 came along, Microsoft started getting
    manufacturers to ship computers running Windows with a UEFI feature called
    Secure Boot enabled by default. Secure Boot was intended to be a security
    feature which effectively prevented any other operating system from being
    installed onto the computer by blocking "unverified software," meaning that
    in order to be ran on this hardware, a specific linux distribution must
    <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-confirms-that-uefi-secure-boot-might-lock-out-linux-and-older-versions-of-windows-from-new-pcs/">beg microsoft to let their distribution boot.</a> Some
    manufacturers even made it either very difficult or plain impossible
    to disable Secure Boot with the version of UEFI they used.</p>
  <li>On Microsoft's Windows 7, 8 and 10 operating systems, collection of data from users is rampant.</li>
  <p>Microsoft
    <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2979054/windows-security/windows-7-8-10-now-all-collecting-user-data-for-microsoft.html">slurps up user data</a>
    like an excited kid drinking a milkshake. Almost anything you do while in a
    Windows environment is collected and sent to the mothership, and if you
    don't like it, too bad, because there's a good chance it's either really
    complicated or impossible to change operating systems now.</p>
  <li>On Windows 10, Microsoft just slaps ads right there in your menus.</li>
  <p>As if Windows didn't have enough problems, Microsoft decided to go ahead
    and <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-remove-advertising-windows-10">throw in some ads</a> to pollute your screen and make them money. You could
    argue this is somewhat okay because Windows 10 is free, but what about the
    people who <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/man-sues-microsoft-seeking-new-copy-of-windows-7-after-forced-windows-10-upgrade/">payed for an older version</a> and were forced to upgrade to Windows 10 anyways?</p>

  Microsoft does not respect its customers as users, rather it now treats them
  as a product. They trap you in a cage that earns them money every time you
  turn it on.<br/>
