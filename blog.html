      <h2><a href="/2018/11/02/windows.html">Why don't I like Windows? (and Microsoft in general)</a></h2>
      <p><ul>
  <li>If you buy a piece of hardware, it should be your property. </li>
  <p>When you buy a computer from a computer retailer, what you are paying for
    is the hardware that makes up a computer system. It should be reasonable
    to say that you are allowed to run whatever software you desire on this
    hardware you purchased, and for most computers for most of the time that
    computers have been around, this was true.</p>
  <li>Microsoft denies users partially or fully of this control</li>
  <p>Around the time that Windows 8 came along, Microsoft started getting
    manufacturers to ship computers running Windows with a UEFI feature called
    Secure Boot enabled by default. Secure Boot was intended to be a security
    feature which effectively prevented any other operating system from being
    installed onto the computer by blocking "unverified software," meaning that
    in order to be ran on this hardware, a specific linux distribution must
    <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-confirms-that-uefi-secure-boot-might-lock-out-linux-and-older-versions-of-windows-from-new-pcs/">beg microsoft to let their distribution boot.</a> Some
    manufacturers even made it either very difficult or plain impossible
    to disable Secure Boot with the version of UEFI they used.</p>
  <li>On Microsoft's Windows 7, 8 and 10 operating systems, collection of data from users is rampant.</li>
  <p>Microsoft
    <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2979054/windows-security/windows-7-8-10-now-all-collecting-user-data-for-microsoft.html">slurps up user data</a>
    like an excited kid drinking a milkshake. Almost anything you do while in a
    Windows environment is collected and sent to the mothership, and if you
    don't like it, too bad, because there's a good chance it's either really
    complicated or impossible to change operating systems now.</p>
  <li>On Windows 10, Microsoft just slaps ads right there in your menus.</li>
  <p>As if Windows didn't have enough problems, Microsoft decided to go ahead
    and <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-remove-advertising-windows-10">throw in some ads</a> to pollute your screen and make them money. You could
    argue this is somewhat okay because Windows 10 is free, but what about the
    people who <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/man-sues-microsoft-seeking-new-copy-of-windows-7-after-forced-windows-10-upgrade/">payed for an older version</a> and were forced to upgrade to Windows 10 anyways?</p>

      <h2><a href="/2018/11/01/javascript.html">Why don't I like javascript?</a></h2>
      <p><p>Any client<->server service not located on the web will have the client connect to the server and request resources and information from that server. It is then the server's job to do whatever processing is necessary in order to deliver that information, hence the name: server. It serves you information. </p>
<p>The implementation of javascript into a user's browser allows websites to remotely execute code of their choosing on that user's machine, offloading the job of the server onto the user. This also allows for arbitrary data collection from the user, which is definitely the opposite of the client's job in this relationship. Once a company running a website, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. gets access to your data, they tend to sell it to data brokers who sell it to places like advertising companies and government agencies. Hurray for javascript. </p>
<p>Javascript has the added bonus of causing the user to experience performance issues doing something as simple as interacting with or visiting a webpage. Something most computers have been able to do for almost 2 decades now.  
<p>This website is served as a series of completely static pages generated from some simple templates using a ruby gem called Jekyll. It simply outputs plain html and css files and I host them. It's that easy.

      <h2><a href="/2018/10/31/firstpost.html">The First Post</a></h2>
      <p>I started programming (or at least trying to program) about 6 years ago, I was always fascinated with it and really wanted to learn how to create my own computer games and tools. I've learned or tried to learn Ruby, Python, Scheme, C++, C, Perl and various assembly languages, yet I've always been drawn to this idea of having my own little place on the internet. Thus, I began work on an idealistically simple and lightweight homepage yesterday, and today I'm making a blog post for it. Here's to this project not dying like my dnd game...
